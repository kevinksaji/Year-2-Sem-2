# Matrix Chain Multiplication (Bottom Up approach)

# initialise matrices m to hold the total multiplication for each combination
# initialise matrix s to track the position of the split

m = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
s = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

for i in range(1, n+1):
    m[i][i] = 0 # base cases
