# Implement function partition with pivot the last element x = A[r]
# After this function, all elements smaller than or equal to x are on the left side of x,
# and all elements greater than x are on the right side of x
# This function should return the index of the pivot
# There shouldn't be any declaration of lists, dictionaries or sets.

def partition(A, p, r):
    # A is a list, p is the starting index and r is the ending index, both inclusive
    # This function should return the index of the pivot
